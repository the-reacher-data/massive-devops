# Massive DevOps

A comprehensive collection of GitHub Actions designed for Python projects using **Trunk-Based Development** and **Conventional Commits**. This repository provides a complete DevOps toolkit that automates code quality, testing, security analysis, documentation generation, and package publishing.

> **Status**: This project is currently in development but already functional. All actions are working and can be used in production environments.

## üöÄ Features

- **Trunk-Based Development**: Optimized for continuous integration with main branch workflows
- **Conventional Commits**: Automatic changelog generation and semantic versioning
- **Complete Python Workflow**: From linting to publishing
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Professional reports with logos, badges, and detailed analysis
- **Modular Design**: Use individual actions or combine them for complete workflows

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Trunk-Based Development Workflow

This toolkit is designed around **Trunk-Based Development** principles:

- **Main Branch**: All development happens on the main branch
- **Short-Lived Branches**: Feature branches are merged quickly
- **Continuous Integration**: Every commit triggers quality checks
- **Automated Releases**: Semantic versioning and changelog generation

### Conventional Commits Integration

All actions support **Conventional Commits** specification:

- **Automatic Categorization**: Commits are grouped by type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- **Changelog Generation**: Automatic changelog creation from commit messages
- **Semantic Versioning**: Version bumps based on commit types
- **Release Notes**: Professional release documentation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Python Project Setup

```yaml
name: Python CI/CD
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

## üö¶ Workflow Patterns

### Complete CI/CD Workflows

This repository includes **two complementary workflows** designed to work together:

#### 1. Pre-Release Workflow (`workflows/python/pre_release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Handles Pull Request validation and pre-release testing.

**Triggers**: Pull Request events (opened, synchronize)

**What it does**:

- üßπ **Linting & Type Checking**: Runs Ruff + MyPy
- üîí **Security Analysis**: Runs Bandit security scanner
- üß™ **Testing & Coverage**: Runs pytest with coverage analysis
- üì¶ **Pre-release Publishing**: Publishes to TestPyPI (if deployable)
- üìö **Documentation Preview**: Generates documentation preview
- üìù **Changelog Preview**: Generates changelog from conventional commits

#### 2. Production Release Workflow (`workflows/python/production_release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Handles production releases and deployment.

**Triggers**: Push to main branch (after PR merge)

**What it does**:

- üîç **Branch Detection**: Finds the original PR branch from squash commit
- üß™ **Final Testing**: Runs tests on the merged code
- üìù **Version Generation**: Creates semantic version based on branch name
- üìã **Changelog Generation**: Creates release changelog from conventional commits
- üöÄ **Production Publishing**: Publishes to PyPI production
- üìö **Documentation Deployment**: Deploys docs to GitHub Pages
- üîñ **Git Tagging**: Creates version tags
- üõ°Ô∏è **CodeQL Analysis**: Runs security analysis

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: These workflows are **complementary** and designed to work together. Using only one workflow may not provide complete functionality. For optimal results, use both workflows as part of your complete CI/CD pipeline.

    secrets:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      pypi-secret: ${{ secrets.TEST_PYPI_TOKEN }}

  production-release:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    uses: ./.github/workflows/python/production_release.yml
    with:
      python-version: "3.11"
      src-dir: "src"
      test-dir: "tests"
      github-sha: ${{ github.sha }}
    secrets:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      pypi-secret: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
    permissions:
